**Graphs** are sets of objects and connections, possibly with weights and orientation. Graphs are useful models for a vast number of difficult and important problems, and the design of algorithms for processing graphs is a major field of study. We consider depth-first search, breadth-first search, connectivity problems, and several algorithms and applications, including Kruskal’s and Prim’s algorithms for finding minimum spanning tree and Dijkstra’s and the Bellman-Ford algorithms for solving shortest-paths problems.

To consider a problem as a graph is often a very good abstraction to apply, since well known graph algorithms for distance, search, connectivity, cycle-detection etc. will then yield a solution to the original problem. There are 3 basic ways to represent a graph in memory (objects and pointers, matrix, and adjacency list); familiarize yourself with each representation and its pros/cons. You should know the basic graph traversal algorithms, breadth-first search and depth-first search. Know their computational complexity, their tradeoffs and how to implement them in real code.
