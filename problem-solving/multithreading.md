You should understand processes, threads, concurrency issues, locks, mutexes, semaphores, monitors and how they all work. Understand deadlock, livelock and how to avoid them. Know what resources a process needs and a thread needs. Understand how context switching works, how it's initiated by the operating system and underlying hardware. Know a little about scheduling. The world is rapidly moving towards multi-core, so know the fundamentals of "modern" concurrency constructs.
