How to solve a problem
-----------------------

You should especially know about the most famous classes of NP-complete problems, such as traveling salesman and the knapsack problem. Be able to recognize them when an interviewer asks you in disguise. Find out what NP-complete means.
 

Algorithms 
-------------

A logical arithmetical or computational procedure that if correctly applied ensures the solution of a problem.

**Turing Machine** - a hypothetical universal computing machine able to modify its original instructions by reading, erasing, or writing a new symbol on a moving tape of fixed length that acts as its program. The concept was instrumental in the early development of computer systems.

Computational complexity
------------------------
- time complexity
- space complexity
- Big O (asymptotic complexity)
